# Phonebook-project

<p>This is a project mainly focused on OOP and a bit of maps.</p>
<p>PhonebookApp.java is the final class file.</p>
<p>With this projected i started off with name and phoneNumber classes then created another class, PhonebookEntry, where i used composition. this was to check for duplicates numbers and names in the file. I then made a phonebook class using composition as well. this class allowed for user iput to search for a number by name and vice versa.</p>
This was a college project.
